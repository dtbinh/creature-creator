I worked on an artificial intelligence project which aimed to develop an innovative system for generating virtual agents in multi-agents systems environments. We worked in collaboration with the car company: Renault and the virtual reality company: Oktal to implement this new system in their car simulator Â© SCANeR. 

I was in charge to develop a Swing JAVA [applet](http://matthieumacret.com/impact/applet.html) to illustrate this system. 

You can browse the [javadoc](http://matthieumacret.com/impact/javadoc/) for more information.

##Limitations
* On MAC OS X, the JAVA applet might be flashing. I am working on correcting that.

##More info

* More information about the project and implementation can be find in this [report](http://matthieumacret.com/pdf/reportImpact.pdf).
* The slides of the presentation in French are on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/matthieumacret/impact-27115402).
